# Review against SPEC.md (M12)

Every item in the brief, where it lives, and how it's checked. "e2e mN" is `e2e/mN-*.spec.ts`, and
screenshots are in `docs/screenshots/`. Anything not done is explained at the end and in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## 2. Originality
| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Original title in one constant | Done: `GAME_TITLE = 'Citybloom'` in `src/config.ts` |
| No SimCity/EA/Maxis names, art, text or sounds | Done: all models, icons and audio are generated in code |
| Third-party licences recorded | Done: `CREDITS.md` (three.js, Preact, fflate: MIT) |

## 3. Platform and stack
| Item | Status |
|---|---|

| WebGL2, HTML/CSS UI over the canvas, design tokens as custom properties | Done: Preact, `src/ui/styles/tokens.css` |
| 60 fps at ~100k residents; no hitches at top speed | Sim side met (`bench.ts --big`: avg 0.6–0.8 ms, worst 9–14 ms per tick); render side at 288 draw calls. The frame rate itself needs the Mac check (PROGRESS.md) |

## 4. Architecture

## 8. Verification
| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Unit tests for demand, growth, economy (to the dollar), coverage, pathfinding, happiness, saves, determinism | Done: `tests/` (19 files) |
| Scenario tests (served town grows, no power declines, taxes cut demand, congestion rises and relief works); invariants every tick in test mode | Done: `tests/*` with `sim.testMode`; balance runs with `--invariants` |
| e2e through the real UI with screenshots, failing on console errors | Done: `e2e/` (15 tests) |
| Screenshots reviewed | Done each milestone; latest in `docs/screenshots/` |
| Performance benchmark | Done: `scripts/bench.ts` (and `--big` for ~100k) |
| Balance tool: careful / greedy / neglectful for 20+ years | Done: `scripts/balance.ts` |
| Long soak with zero console errors | Done: `npm run soak` (10 minutes of top-speed play with disasters, panels, maps, saves) |
| §9 final playthrough via tests and screenshots | Done: `npm run playthrough` (a first city through the real UI, menu to year two; `docs/screenshots/m12-play-*.png`) |
| §9 README (run, build, play); summary and ideas at the top of PROGRESS.md | Done |

## Not done, and why
- **Trams and trains** (§5 transport, "if time allows") and the §9 extras (neighbouring cities, weather
  and seasons, more specialisations, glTF models) weren't built; the time went on depth and polish in
  the required systems. The asset registry and the transit system (lines, stops, riders) are where
  they would plug in. Listed as next steps at the top of PROGRESS.md.
- **Visitors in traffic** (M10): tourists are counted, spend and shop, but don't drive through the
  traffic model.
- **Render triangle budget**: 2.5M at the whole-city overview of a 100k city (half of it the shadow
  pass) against an early 1.5M target; draw calls are within budget. Flagged for the Mac check.

# SPEC-2.md (phase 2, M13–M24)

Each phase-2 milestone mapped to where it's done. Filled in as milestones complete.

## Rules for all of phase 2

| Rule | Where |
|---|---|
| Work in order, each milestone playable, UI-tested with screenshots, `M<n> complete:` commits | git history; `e2e/m13-*.spec.ts` onwards; `docs/screenshots/m13-*.png` onwards |
| New saved state bumps the save version with a migration and a test that older saves load and play on | M13: SAVE_VERSION 12 (`terrainDelta`), `tests/grading.test.ts` loads the version-10 playtest save |
| M12 performance budget kept; bench and balance rerun per milestone | numbers per milestone in PROGRESS.md |
| Everything original | procedural models, icons and sounds, as in phase 1 |
| Player kept informed (tooltips, shortcuts, tips, advisor hints, maps and inspector lines) | per milestone below |
| README and this section kept current; real-hardware checks under "To check on the Mac" | README.md, PROGRESS.md |

## M13 Gentler roads

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| Smoothed vertical profile per road; grade measured on it | `src/sim/world/grading.ts` (40 m smoothing, fit within the limit, pinned at junctions); DESIGN.md §3.15 |
| Cut and fill under the road and to each side, visible embankments and cuttings | `src/sim/world/earthworks.ts` (formation, a bench that widens with the cut or fill, 1:1 cuttings, 1:3 embankments); terrain tint in `src/render/terrain.ts`; `docs/screenshots/m13-cutting.png` |
| Per-type grade limits; only extreme ground fails | `RoadType.maxGrade` in `src/data/roads.ts` (streets 16 %, boulevards 8 %); a cutting deeper than 14 m is the only land failure |
| Bridge over dry ground where fill is very tall | viaducts (`RoadSegment.deck`) where fill passes 8 m |
| Earthworks cost ∝ volume | $0.40/m³ in the road's price (`GRADING.costPerCubicMetre`): nothing extra at grade, a median 73 % on a street over 15 %+ ground; civic pads likewise |
| Preview shows grade along the ghost, colours too-steep sections, says by how much and what fixes it | `src/render/ghost.ts` (graded ghost, colours, cut/fill posts), `src/tools/roadTool.ts` (hint), reasons in `grading.ts`; `docs/screenshots/m13-preview.png`, `m13-too-steep.png` |
| Terrain edits saved as deltas on the seed | `SimState.terrainDelta`, save v12, `FrameDiff.terrain` |
| Nearby zone cells, buildings and trees adapt; nothing floats or sinks | `Sim.groundMoved` (re-seat), cells revalidated, trees cleared on moved ground; level pads for civic buildings; tested in `tests/grading.test.ts` |
| Existing saves load unchanged | migration 11 → 12 (zero delta); test loads the v10 playtest save and checks the ground is the seed's |
| Done when: sampled random streets across all presets refused only on extreme ground (before/after), screenshots of clean earthworks with buildings beside them | before 20.7 % refused (90 % on 8–15 % ground), after 0.7 %, only on ≥ 35 % ground (`scripts/dev/grades.ts`, `tests/grading.test.ts`); `scripts/dev/earthshot.mjs` town on a ridge |
